# Autonomous-Mobot
The aim of this project was to design the Autonomous Robot (or the Mobot) based on Arduino Uno board. The Mobot has to perform a set of tasks: move around the specified area avoiding hitting the obstacles, detect the blue cube within the working area, grab the blue cube and move it outside the area.
